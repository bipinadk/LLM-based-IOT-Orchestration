🧠 IOrch: Intelligent Orchestration Prototype
This repository contains a prototype for intelligent service orchestration using OpenAI's language models. The system likely supports planning and analysis tasks via a few-shot prompting strategy.

📁 Contents
IOrch.ipynb: Main Jupyter notebook implementing the orchestration logic using OpenAI's API and predefined few-shot examples.

fewshots/: Local module likely containing example prompts for the LLM to emulate reasoning or planning.

⚙️ Requirements
Install the necessary dependencies:

bash
pip install openai

You will also need:

An OpenAI API key (OPENAI_API_KEY) set in your environment variables.

A fewshots.py module in the working directory with analyser_fs and planner_fs examples defined.

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository and navigate into it.

Ensure your environment is set up with the required API key and modules.

Open IOrch.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or VSCode.

Execute the cells sequentially.

📝 Notes
The notebook is currently not documented. Adding markdown explanations for each section is recommended.

The current workflow appears to involve:

Analyzing device or system state using LLM.

Generating a deployment plan based on constraints and examples.
